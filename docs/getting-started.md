# Planning Center Frontend Design Challenge

### Getting Started:

1. Install dependencies (`yarn install` or `npm install`)

2. Start Vite app (`yarn dev` or `npm run dev`)

3. Open using `localhost` (defaults to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) but Vite will pick an alternative port if `3000` is in use)
